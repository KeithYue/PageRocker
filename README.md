PageRocker
==========

A chrome extension which can track user's head to control the display of the webpage the user visiting. When zooming in or out, we keep the modal of div static, we just adjust the textual element.

#### Todo
* add the status control of the tracking video(backgroud control or event page)
* design the ui: 
    * Fixed UI size
    * tracking status showing
    * user control ui interface
    * status control: stop, start, init the tracker(event listening and so on)
* add head track and reload function

#### Issues
* can not close the camera when the tracker is closed


#### Open
* add 3D page rotate function(Wikipedia: Head-coupled perspective, using headtracking event instead of facetracking)
* Displays an interactive webpage within a Three.js and add head-coupled effect.
